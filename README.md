Gilhari is a microservice that facilitates database-to-database, application-to-database, or database-to-application data transfer. It exposes a RElational State Transfer interface to provide APIs like GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE to perform operations on JSON objects. It is available in a Docker image and can be configured as required by the application and specific database structures. Architecturally, it sits in between an application and a database and provides APIs for modification and retrieval of data from the database. More information regarding the microservice can be found [here.](https://www.softwaretree.com/v1/products/gilhari/gilhari_introduction.php)

This repository is a copy of the Gilhari microservice configured to post 50 JSON objects to a database. The overall functionality of the microservice extends way beyond this repository. The tutorial and instructions to use this configured copy is given in README.pdf within the repository.
